# Biogas-cookstove-design-and-cfd
Computational Design Tool for household biogas burner 

# Objective
This repository contains a MATLAB-based computational tool developed to support the parametric design of biogas cookstove. The model calculates key design parameters such as injector diameter, port size, and airflow requirements based on engineering assumptions.

# Context
The tool was developed as part of a Master’s thesis in Energy Engineering focused on clean cooking technologies and energy efficiency in developing contexts.

# Methodology

- Input parameters: thermal power, fuel properties, air–fuel ratio assumptions

- Computational approach: deterministic engineering calculations

- Outputs: injector diameter, port sizing, and recommended design ranges

# Programming and Modeling Skills Demonstrated

- MATLAB scripting

- Engineering calculations and unit handling

- Parametric analysis

- Translation of physical concepts into code

# CFD Analysis
Complementary computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses were conducted using ANSYS Fluent to study airflow and thermal behavior. A short technical report summarizing the CFD workflow and results is provided in this repository.

# Limitations
This is a simplified engineering design tool and does not include detailed combustion chemistry or transient CFD modeling.
